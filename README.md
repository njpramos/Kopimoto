About the owner.

I’m a self-confessed coffee lover since I was in secondary school. I really can’t start a morning without sipping a cup of coffee to jumpstart the day. So I’ve decided to establish my own coffee shop business to share my passion to other people and at the same time to profit out of it. I personally choose the “Kopimoto” brand name because I think it’s simple and catchy.
